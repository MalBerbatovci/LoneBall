# Loneball 

A simple application that I made in order to understand the techniques that are required in game development. The code is taken from James Cho's book 'The beginner's guide to android game development', to which I added the powerup features and the help screen.

## To Run

Simply download the loneBall.jar file and run using 'java -jar loneBall.jar'
